# **Contributing**

Suggestions and improvements are always welcome! 

## **Expectations Before Contributing**

Please create a GitHub issue on this repository, so we can discuss your use case or
improvement request to ensure that we are aligned and there won't be any unexpected
consequences of your proposed modifications. 

## **How to Contribute**

Once alignment has been achieved, and the specifications for the new contribution
have been finalized, feel free to fork this repository, make your modifications and
issue a Pull Request back to the default branch. We suggest that you work off a branch
in your forked repository and submit a pull request from your branch, allowing you to
always keep your forked default branch in sync with the origin repository's default branch.

You can expect to receive a code review for your contribution within 2 weeks. Please
contact a Maintainer or Trusted Committer if you experience any undue delays. 

Once all code review comments have been addressed, the PR can be merged into the master
branch.

## **Expectations After Contributing**

Once your PR has been merged to the default branch please allow 1 week for a new release
build to be published as an official release build.
